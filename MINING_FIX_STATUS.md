# GMINE Mining Fix Status

## Phase 1: Timing Synchronization Fix âœ… COMPLETE

### Problem
- Miner was using local block calculations causing timing drift
- Transactions submitted with insufficient time remaining before phase transitions
- Result: "Wrong phase" errors (79 in previous run)

### Solution Implemented
- Added `submission_buffer_blocks` configuration (default: 8 blocks)
- Both commit and reveal check if `blocks_remaining >= submission_buffer_blocks`
- Prevents submissions when insufficient time for transaction processing

### Results
- **Wrong phase errors for commit/reveal: 79 â†’ 0** (100% elimination!)
- Safety buffer working perfectly - preventing late submissions
- Initial epochs showed 100% reveal success rate

### Command Line Usage
```bash
./mine-rust.sh                              # Default 8 blocks buffer
./mine-rust.sh --submission-buffer-blocks 10  # More conservative
./mine-rust.sh --submission-buffer-blocks 5   # More aggressive
```

## Phase 2: Nonce Overflow Issue ðŸ”§ IN PROGRESS

### Problem Discovered
- After fixing timing issues, new problem emerged
- "Nonce out of range" errors causing reveal failures
- Success rate degrading over time: 25.8% reveals, 37.5% claims

### Root Cause Analysis
The nonce generation uses wrapping arithmetic that can overflow:

```rust
let rotated_offset = partition_offset.wrapping_add(epoch_rotation * nonce_space);
let max_nonce = rotated_offset.wrapping_add(nonce_space);
```

For high epoch numbers + certain partitions:
- Calculated ranges approach or exceed u64::MAX
- Example: Epoch 14765 range started at 18040915704087940878 (very close to u64::MAX)
- Miners generate nonces that fail on-chain validation

### Why It Degrades Over Time
1. Early epochs: Low rotation values, no overflow
2. Later epochs: Higher rotation Ã— nonce_space causes overflow
3. Affects miners with high partition seeds most severely

### Proposed Solution (Pending Implementation)
Restructure calculation to rotate partition IDs instead of raw nonces:
1. Calculate partition ID (0-999)
2. Apply epoch rotation to partition ID
3. Calculate final nonce range from rotated partition
4. Ensure last partition extends to u64::MAX

This maintains fairness while preventing overflow.

## Next Steps
1. Deep dive analysis with Gemini Pro
2. Verify root cause with detailed log analysis
3. Implement and test the restructured nonce calculation
4. Ensure no other hidden issues exist
