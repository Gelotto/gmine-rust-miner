echo "There are now TWO different experiences:"

echo "1. NON-INTERACTIVE (curl | sh) - What you've been testing:"
echo "   - Shows formatted quick start guide"
echo "   - Clear 3-step instructions"
echo "   - Lists all gmine commands"
echo ""
echo "2. INTERACTIVE (download then run) - The new enhanced experience:"
echo "   - Asks to configure PATH automatically"
echo "   - Detects your shell (bash/zsh/fish)"
echo "   - Modifies the right config file"
echo "   - Sets PATH for current session"
echo "   - Offers to run 'gmine init' immediately"
echo ""
echo "To test the INTERACTIVE experience:"
echo ""
echo "  # Download first (makes it interactive)"
echo "  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gelotto/gmine-rust-miner/main/install.sh -o install.sh"
echo "  chmod +x install.sh"
echo "  ./install.sh"
echo ""
echo "This will:"
echo "1. Install gmine"
echo "2. ASK: 'Modify ~/.bashrc to add gmine to PATH? [Y/n]'"
echo "3. If yes, configure PATH automatically"
echo "4. ASK: 'Would you like to set up your miner now? [Y/n]'"
echo "5. If yes, run the setup wizard"
echo ""
echo "The one-liner (curl | sh) remains non-interactive for security,"
echo "but now shows much clearer instructions!"
