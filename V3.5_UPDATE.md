# GMINE V3.5 Update - Migration Capability

## Overview

V3.5 introduces migration capability to the GMINE contracts, preventing the need for future deployment-only updates.

## Contract Updates

### New V3.5 Contracts (Deployed 2025-09-03)
- **Mining Contract**: `inj1vd520adql0apl3wsuyhhpptl79yqwxx73e4j66`
- **Power Token**: `inj1esn6fgltm0fvqe2n57cdkvtwwpyyf9due8ps49`

### Previous V3.4 Contracts
- **Mining Contract**: `inj1h2rq8q2ly6mwgwv4jcd5qpjvfqwvwee5v9n032`
- **Power Token**: `inj18ju0hzpu5ylz0nh7dcwcrssnh8aq4vdhmnr2vg`

## Key Features in V3.5

1. **Migration Capability**
   - Added `migrate` entry point to contracts
   - Semver-based version checking for safe upgrades
   - Future updates can be done via migration instead of redeployment

2. **Configurable Parameters**
   - All hardcoded constants moved to Config struct
   - Parameters can be updated via migration
   - No more being blocked by hardcoded values

3. **MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT Reduced**
   - Reduced from 1000 POWER to 100 POWER
   - More accessible for miners to participate in staking

4. **All V3.4 Fixes Included**
   - Just-in-Time History reconstruction
   - Orchestrator epoch advancement fixes
   - All V3.3 safety features

## Miner Updates

The gmine-rust-miner has been updated to use the new V3.5 contracts:

1. `src/config/mod.rs` - Updated default contract addresses
2. `src/chain/queries.rs` - Updated ContractAddresses::testnet()
3. `src/chain/messages/mod.rs` - Updated MINING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS constant
4. `gmine_mobile_lib/src/chain/contracts.rs` - Added V3.5 constants and updated testnet config

## Migration Benefits

With V3.5, future updates can be performed without:
- Creating new contract addresses
- Losing user state and history
- Complex coordination for users to switch contracts
- Redeploying the entire ecosystem

## Next Steps

1. Monitor V3.5 contracts for proper operation
2. Test migration capability with a minor update
3. Update telemetry system if needed
4. Communicate new contracts to community

## Testing

To verify your miner is using V3.5:
```bash
# Check logs for contract addresses
grep "inj1vd520adql0apl3wsuyhhpptl79yqwxx73e4j66" miner-log.txt

# Or run miner and check which contracts it's connecting to
./mine-rust.sh -m "your mnemonic"
```
